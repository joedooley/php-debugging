# WordPress Starter Plugin

This repo is the starter plugin for [Developing Designs](https://www.developingdesigns.com/).


## Features

This plugin includes the following features:

1. [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) - Dependency Manager for PHP
2. [Kint](http://raveren.github.io/kint/) - Awesome package that helps you to debug - forget `var_dump` and `print_r`. You are going to love Kint.
3. [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) - Oh man, you will wonder why this isn't built into PHP. When an error occurs, this displayer replaces out the PHP orange table and gives you information you can actually use.

2. Put into your `wp-content/plugins/` folder
3. Extract it
4. Go into the new folder
